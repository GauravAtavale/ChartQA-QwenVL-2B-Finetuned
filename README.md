# Multimodal-Reasoning-Pipeline
A model that shows you possible questions when you upload an image and a title



Idea is when I upload an image and a title, It should prompt top 10 questions i can ask and get answers from


Datasets and use cases that can be used are as follows:

1. DocVQA Dataset - 
https://www.docvqa.org/datasets

Use Case: Extracting information from documents, invoices, forms, and scanned papers by answering 
questions about their content

2. ChartQA dataset - Chart and graph comprehension

Notes to self:
Most likely be finalizing working on ChartQA dataset. This is amazing since this is what we need in industry the most - any company any team
